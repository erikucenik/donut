# Donut shaped C code that generates a 3D spinning donut

(Obviously inspired on [this article](https://www.a1k0n.net/2006/09/15/obfuscated-c-donut.html))

I wanted to try to develop some projection mathematics without ever having read anything about the topic.

The result has obvious flaws and there are much better ways to do this but it was a fun experiment!
